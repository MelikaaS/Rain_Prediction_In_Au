I'm going to practice classification algorithms such as 
*  Logistic Regression
*  KNN
*  DecisionTree
*  SVM
  
 to create a model based on training data set and evaluate testing data using evaluation metrics such as
* Acuuracy Score
* Jaccard Index
* F1_Score
* LogLoss
* Mean Absolute Error
* Mean Squared Error
* R2-Score

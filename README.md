I'm going to practice classification algorithms sch as Logistic Regression, KNN, DecisionTree, SVM to create a model based on training data set and evaluate testing data using evaluation metrics such as 'Acuuracy Score', 'Jaccard Index', 'F1_Score', 'LogLoss', 'Mean Absolute Error', 'Mean Squared Error' and 'R2-Score'
